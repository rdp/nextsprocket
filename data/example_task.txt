Example Title:
Markdown lexer/parser/translator to HTML
Make NArray Gem JRuby compatible

Example Description:
Current Markdown implementations fail many edge cases because regex cannot keep state. It also becomes unmanageable to fix due to the complexity of the regex codebase. A better implementation would be one which uses a lexer/parser/translator paradigm like ANTLR.

Example Requirements:
This is a sample you can base your requirements on.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

- A lexer/parser/translator approach to translating Markdown to HTML
- Input is text formatted in Markdown.
- Output is corresponding HTML code.
- Details of Markdown:
 http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown
- Must be implemented with a automated modern lexer/parser tool.
These tools uses a grammar file to auto-generates the lexer/parser. Antlr is one example.
- Must pass the MarkdownTest unit tests as referenced here:
http://six.pairlist.net/pipermail/markdown-discuss/2004-December/000909.html
